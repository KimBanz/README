# *My preferred communication style*
-for quick consults, a greeting and the request in a single line
-for multiple questions or tasks, an email or ticket
-for things that could be of use to others, somewhere public or even better, DOCUMENTED!
-when I have something to say to someone? if positive, in public. if negative, in private

# *What gives me energy*
-learning new things
-being around proactive people
-visuals like charts and flow diagrams along with text



# *What drains me*
-I start to work on an issue, and the original person does not circle back and tell me it is resolved
-email forwards with no context
-no communication if I am on the right track or doing things right
